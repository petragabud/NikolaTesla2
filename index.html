      <h2>FAMOUS QUOTES</h2>
      <p>“I don't care that they stole my idea... I care that they don't have any of their own.”</p>
      <p>“My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration. I have not penetrated into the secrets of this core, but I know that it exists.”</p>
      <p>“The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter – for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way. He lives and labors and hopes.”</p>
